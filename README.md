## Bongo Python Coding Test

### Problem 1
#### How to run the program?
* Clone the repository
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Type `python3 dictionary_depth/main.py`
* You'll get desired output.

**If you want to change the dictionary then, open the main.py on your favorite code editor. And change it from `if __name__ == '__main__'` section below.**

#### How to run the tests?
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Copy the following line and paste on your terminal.  
* >`python3 -m unittest dictionary_depth/tests.py`


### Problem 2
#### How to run the program?
* Clone the repository
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Type `python3 object_depth/main.py`
* You'll get desired output.

**If you want to change the dictionary then, open the main.py on your favorite code editor. And change it from `if __name__ == '__main__'` section below.**

#### How to run the tests?
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Copy the following line and paste on your terminal.  
* >`python3 -m unittest object_depth/tests.py`


### Problem 3
#### How to run the program?
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Type `python3 lca_graph/main.py`
* You'll get desired output.

#### How to run the tests?
* Open your Terminal and navigate into this directory.
* Copy the following line and paste on your terminal.  
* >`python3 -m unittest lca_graph/tests.py`

#### Explain time and memory complexity.
Time complexity of the above solution is O(n). This does a simple tree traversal in bottom up fashion.
And it doesn't require extra memory for holding the array. 

**If you want to change the tree, you need to make a new tree with `Node` class.**
